multispawn
=========

Extremely basic mod by Shara RedCat for multiple spawn points. Written for Billre.

Note: This is mostly intended as a working concept. 
Better implementation can be done later if needed.


How to Use 
-----------

Set desired spawn points in minetest.conf for:
spawn_coordinate_1, spawn_coordinate_2, spawn_coordinate_3, spawn_coordinate_4

You can expand this with additional spawn points by editing the code in init.lua.
It should be simple. Ask if you need help.

The /spawn command teleports the player to the highest level spawn they have the  priv for.
